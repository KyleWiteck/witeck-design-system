They are the foundation of the Witeck Design System's styling props, providing a
set of predefined style values and enabling TS-friendly IntelliSense.

`Sprinkles` are the core building blocks of the styling system throughout the
entire design library. They define the available style props and their values,
providing a highly flexible and extensible approach to styling components. Since
they are pre-defined, they also provide a type-safe environment for developers
using TypeScript.

To learn more about the design library sprinkles and how they work, you can
refer to the
[vanilla-extract documentation](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/).

:::info

What you see below includes the default theme variables. Some **Sprinkles** are
based on these theme variables. Due to this, the reflecting values can be
altered with different css values, but the prop values will remain consistent.

:::

## Colors

<ColorsTable />

## Spacing

All rem values were based on `16px` which is the standard browser default pixel
size. (Calculation for px size: rem \* 16)

<SpacingTable />

## Shorthand Sprinkles props

These props simplify styling by providing shorter, more intuitive names for
commonly used CSS properties. Some shorthand props apply a value to multiple
related CSS properties, while others are simplified aliases for single
properties.

```tsx live
function Shorthand() {
  return (
    <Box paddingX="20" ratio="16:9" bg="primary" height="20" shadow="base" />
  );
}
```
