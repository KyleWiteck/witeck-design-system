Learn the basics of styling with the `Box` component and explore its wide range
of style properties to create custom layouts and designs.

## Fundaments

Styling is a fundamental aspect of creating visually appealing and cohesive user
interfaces. In this section, we will explore the basics of styling within our
design system, focusing on key concepts and techniques to help you achieve the
desired look and feel for your applications.

Throughout this documentation, we will cover various aspects of styling,
including layout, spacing, typography, colors, and more. By understanding these
fundamental principles, you will be able to create visually stunning and
consistent designs.

While working with our design system, you will frequently encounter the `Box`
component, which serves as a versatile building block for styling and layout.
The `Box` component provides a wide range of style props that can be applied to
customize the appearance of components. It is also the core of all the design
libraries components. We will explore these style props in detail and learn how
to use them effectively.

Let's dive into the styling basics and discover the tools and techniques that
will empower you to create beautifully designed user interfaces. If you have any
questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Let's get started!

## Styling Props

Achieve personalized designs by applying specific styling props to Magnit Design
Library components, allowing for seamless customization. It is recommended to
prioritize the use of Magnit Design Library's built-in styling props for
customization before exploring alternative styling approaches.

```tsx live
<Box width="18" height="18" marginX="auto" backgroundColor="primary" />
```

This simple code snippet demonstrates the usage of styling props, allowing you
to effortlessly customize your components.

## Responsive Props

The library components supports responsive props, which allow you to define
different property values for different breakpoints. This enables you to create
responsive and adaptive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and
devices.

### Object Form

You can define responsive props using an object with breakpoints as keys and
corresponding values. ([Breakpoints](/docs/utils-api#breakpoints)) For example:

```tsx live
<Box
  backgroundColor={{ mobile: 'error', tablet: 'success', desktop: 'primary' }}
  boxSize="20"
/>
```

In the example above, the **backgroundColor** prop is defined as an object. It
specifies different values for the mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

### Array Form

Alternatively, you can define responsive props using an array, where each
element represents the value for a specific breakpoint. For example:

```tsx live
<Box backgroundColor={['error', 'success', 'primary']} boxSize="20" />
```

In the example above, the **backgroundColor** prop is defined as an array. The
values in the array correspond to the values for the mobile, tablet, and desktop
breakpoints, respectively.

## Using ClassName

You can override component styling by using plain CSS and class names with the
`className` prop. Here's a simple example:

:::warning

It is important to consider using **className** as a last resort when styling
components. When using **className**, it is recommended to check with the design
team or follow their guidelines to ensure that any customizations align with the
Magnit brand and design parameters. This ensures a consistent and cohesive user
experience. Collaborating with the design department helps maintain the overall
design vision and ensures that your customization efforts adhere to the Magnit
brand guidelines.

:::

```tsx
<Box className="custom-class" />
```

In this example, the **className** prop is set to custom-class, allowing you to
apply custom styles to the `Box` component.

By adding your own CSS rules for the custom-class class, you can fully customize
the appearance of the component.

Take advantage of the **className** prop to apply your own styling and achieve
the desired look and feel for your components.

It is important to consider using **className** as a last resort when styling
components. It's recommended to make use of as many available style props as
possible before adding a className. This approach helps to minimize the amount
of CSS added to your project. Even when adding a **className**, it is advisable
to only apply the missing styles using that class name.

```tsx
<Box padding="8" className="custom-class" />
```

```css
/* Bad */
.custom-class {
  padding: 8px;
  :before {
    content: '';
  }
}

/* Good */
.custom-class {
  :before {
    content: '';
  }
}
```
