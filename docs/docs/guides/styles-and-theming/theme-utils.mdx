Provided utilities for theming your application using the Vanilla Extract
library.

It exports various properties that can be used to define and customize the
appearance of your components. By leveraging these utilities, you can create a
consistent and visually appealing design system for your application.

```ts
import {
  accessiblyHidden,
  expandRecipe,
  rotate180Recipe,
  shimmer,
  themeClass,
  varsContract
} from '@peopleticker/magnit-design/theme';
```

## themeClass

This property provides a class name that can be applied to the root element of
your application. It is how the entire design system is applied to your
application. Without this class name, your application will not be styled when
using the `@magnit/design` library.

More information can be found in the
[Builtin theme setup](/docs/guides/introduction/project-setup#builtin-theme-setup)
guide.

## varsContract

This property is used to define the theme variables that can be used to
customize the appearance of your application. It serves as a contract to adhere
to when defining theme variables.

You can find more information on how this could be used in the
[Custom theme setup](/docs/guides/introduction/project-setup#custom-theme-setup)
guide.

## rotate180Recipe

A recipe function from **vanilla-extract** that defines a style for rotating an
element 180 degrees. This recipe provides a transition effect for the
**transform** property, allowing smooth rotation when the `isOpen` variant
changes.

### Structure

- **Base Styles**:

  - `transition: 'transform 300ms ease'`: Applies a 300ms ease transition to the
    **transform** property. This ensures smooth animations when the element is
    rotated.

- **Variants**:

  - `isOpen`: A variant that controls the rotation of the element.
    - `true`: Applies `transform: rotate(180deg)`, rotating the element 180
      degrees.
    - `false`: Applies `transform: rotate(0deg)`, keeping the element in its
      original orientation.

- **Default Variants**:
  - `isOpen: false`: By default, the element does not rotate (`rotate(0deg)`).

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { rotate180Recipe } from '@peopleticker/magnit-design/theme';

const MyComponent = ({ isOpen }) => (
  <div className={rotate180Recipe({ isOpen })}>{/* Content goes here */}</div>
);
```

In this example, when `isOpen` is `true`, the element rotates 180 degrees. When
`isOpen` is `false`, it returns to its original orientation.

## expandRecipe

A recipe function from **vanilla-extract** that defines styles for expanding and
collapsing an element with customizable transition durations. This recipe
manages both visibility and size, making it useful for creating expandable
sections like accordions or dropdowns.

- **Variants**:

  - `ms`: Transition duration.
  - `isOpen`: Controls expansion.
    - `true`: Expands the element (visible, no height restriction).
    - `false`: Collapses the element (hidden, zero height).

- **Defaults**:
  - `isOpen: false` (collapsed)
  - `ms: 300` (300ms transition)

### Example

```tsx
<div className={expandRecipe({ isOpen, ms: 200 })}>{/* Content */}</div>
```

## shimmer

The **shimmer** keyframe defines a shimmering effect by animating the
background's position from left to right.

- **Animation**:
  - `0%`: Starts with background moving from `-100%`.
  - `100%`: Ends with background moving to `100%`.
  - Background color remains consistent (`hsl(200, 20%, 80%)`).

### Example

```tsx
<div style={{ animation: `${shimmer} 2s infinite` }}>{/* Content */}</div>
```

## accessiblyHidden

The **accessiblyHidden** style hides an element visually while keeping it
accessible to screen readers.

- **Styles**:
  - Positions element off-screen (`absolute`, `clip`, `clipPath`).
  - Reduces size and removes visual impact (`width`, `height`, `margin`,
    `padding`, `border`).

### Example

```tsx
<div className={accessiblyHidden}>{/* Hidden but accessible content */}</div>
```
