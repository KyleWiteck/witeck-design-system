A set of icons that are used internally in the design system and exposed for use
in external applications. It is based around the
[Box< 'svg' >](/docs/guides/components/box) component.

## Usage

Our icons are built with ES Modules, so it's completely tree-shakable.

Each icon can be imported as a React component, which renders an inline SVG
element. This way, only the icons that are imported into your project are
included in the final bundle. The rest of the icons are tree-shaken away.

:::warning

`Icons` and `IconsByName` are deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.

:::

```tsx
import { UserIcon } from '@KyleWiteck/witeck-design/icons';

function Example() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      // boxSize combines height and width into a single prop
      <UserIcon boxSize="5" />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

## Props

<PropsTable defaultElement="svg" omitSprinkles={['element']} />

## All Available Icons

<IconsDemo />

## Styling an Icon

```tsx live
<NotificationsIcon
  color="primary"
  width={{ mobile: '22', desktop: '36' }}
  height={{ mobile: 'auto', desktop: 'full' }}
  role="img"
  alt="Notifications"
/>
```

## Technical Details

- Leverages `forwardRef` to handle forwarded refs in on the icons.
- Loads multiple SVG icons as React components from a defined folder structure.
- Supports customizable `height`, `width`, and `boxSize` (defaults to
  [Sprinkles Spacing](/docs/guides/styles-and-theming/sprinkles#Spacing) of `5`)
  props. Also supports all
  [Sprinkles](/docs/guides/styles-and-theming/sprinkles) that the
  [Box](/docs/guides/components/box) component support as an `svg` element.
- All icons are built with ES Modules, so it's completely tree-shakable.
- Ensures icons inherit colors using `currentColor` and removes fixed SVG
  dimensions.
- Implements custom types for icon properties and components.
