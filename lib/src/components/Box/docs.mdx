import { PropsTable } from '@site/src/components/PropsTable';

Polymorphic React Component that forms the foundation of our design components.
By default, it renders as a `div` element, making it a flexible starting point
for designing and laying out content.

## Usage

You can use the `Box` component in your React applications by importing it from
the library.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@KyleWiteck/witeck-design/components';

<Box padding="4">{/* Content goes here */}</Box>;
```

Once imported, you can use the `Box` component to style your content with a vast
majority of style properties out of the box.

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Styling Basics

This accepts a wide range of style properties out of the box, making it highly
versatile for layout and design:

```tsx live
<Box padding="8" border="2px" borderColor="primary">
  <Box backgroundColor="primary" height="20" />
</Box>
```

## The element prop

The `element` prop is a powerful feature that allows you to customize the type
of HTML element rendered by a component. By default, the Box component renders a
`<div>` tag. However, with the `element` prop, you can easily change the
rendered element to any other valid HTML element while still retaining the
functionality and prop styles of the component. Most components in the framework
inherit this prop from the **Box** component, as it serves as the core building
block for all primitive components.

```tsx live
<Box element="section" padding="8" backgroundColor="primary">
  <Stack element="article" backgroundColor="white" padding="8">
    <Button
      element="a"
      variant="outlined"
      href="/magnit-design/docs/guides/components/box#the-element-prop"
    >
      Button Link
    </Button>
  </Stack>
</Box>
```

By leveraging the **element** prop, you can easily control the element types
rendered by your components, enabling you to create the desired structure and
semantics for your web application.

In addition, you can also pass components. For example, you can use the as prop
of the `Button` component to render a
[react-router link](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link) by passing
in a **Link** component. Please note that this approach works for components
that return a React ElementType and support a className prop.

```tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function HomepageLink() {
  return (
    <Button variant="link" element={Link} to="/">
      This is a ReactRouter link back to home
    </Button>
  );
}
```
